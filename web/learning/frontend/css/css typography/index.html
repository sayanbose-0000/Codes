    <p>Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for
      the last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had
      accepted it and come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into
      the ignition, turned it and the engine didn't make a sound.
